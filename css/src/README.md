# GoNoodle CSS Exericse Submission

To give you the best understanding of how I approached this problem, I'll be leaving all of my thoughts from beginning to end here. Todo outlines the steps that I took to do the exercise. Initial thoughts covers the first things I asked myself when I read over the exercise. Final thoughts covers my assumptions and things I would have done in the future to make the solution even better.

## Todo:
1. Stub out first pass of markup
2. Build out component
    a. Typekit
    b. Add images
    c. CSS
3. Set up tooling
    a. Gulp
    b. PostCSS
4. Browserstack free trial
5. Test test test fix fix fix

## Initial Thoughts
* How production should I treat this? Linting + minification? Naming convention?
* Figure out best way to incorporate SVGs. I've typically fallen back to icon fonts, but a good SVG workflow has been on my list of things to do for a while. Maybe this is a good time to try one out.
* Don't forget responsiveness and accessibility.
* It'd be interesting to try a microclasses approach, but I think I'll stick with something more traditional like SuitCSS.
* I think I'll try to implement as much as possible sans-tooling, and then come back over with tooling to make things more production ready.
* Should I sprite these SVGs for performance?
* Will I need js for some of these interactions?
